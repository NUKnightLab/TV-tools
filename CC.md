# Closed Captions

Changes and developments in recent years in the space of technologies related to "television" (broadly speaking) have narrowed rather than widened the technical accessibility (which is to say the hackability) of closed caption feeds.

Closed caption technology itself is a bit of a hack into the video layer of standard broadcast formats (e.g. NTSC and PAL). As the industry has moved more toward streaming formats, this hacked-in technology has gradually given way to more proprietary approaches to managing captions which tend to operate in those services more as traditional "subtitles" have rather than "captions".

These changes affect not only the typical services that come to mind with respect to streaming (Netflix, Amazon Prime, all things Roku, smart television, etc.) but also affect what are thought of as more traditional forms like cable distribution.
